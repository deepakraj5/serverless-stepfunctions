serverless with nodejs

* install serverless via npm
* init serverless project by cmd (serverless)
* select the project template (in my case aws-nodejs)
* install packages for app like (express, aws-sdk, serverless-http, serverless-offline)
	* serverless-offline package is to test the endpoint in the local server
* Create and configure AWS sdk for DynamoDB
* Create a service file for CRUD operation
* in controller create the endpoint for CRUD operation and export with handler using serverless-http
* serverless.yml file:
	* define the handler
	* under the events define the path and method
	* under plugins add "serverless-offline"
* to start the application in local server use the command serverless offline start
* to deploy the application on aws lambda use cmd (sls deploy)
* to allow DynamoDB in lambda function (on aws) need to give permission
	* configuration -> permissions -> select role -> Add permissions -> create inline policy
	* choose DynamoDB service and review policy
